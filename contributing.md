# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all contributions, especially by those who worked through the list and noticed some missing / unclear information! Please use the pull requests to discuss about the usefulness of a change.

**We will make sure the list doesn't grow too long in order not to overwhelm beginners.** Please don't submit links that fullfil similar purpose / contain similar information as links already in the list. Instead, delete the old link and state why yours is superior.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- You spellchecked your text
- The title of the link is descriptive but short
- If necessary, you have added a short description after the link, ending with a period.
- You added some motivation about why this link is useful to beginners into the pull request

Thank you for your suggestions!
