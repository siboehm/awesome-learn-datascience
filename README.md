## Common Algorithms

## Data Science with Python
This list covers only Python, as many are already familiar with this language. For Data Science using R, have a look at this [list of tutorials](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/DataScienceR).

### Learning Python

### Jupyter Notebooks
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web application for easy visualisation and presentation using python.

### scikit-learn
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the most common library for machine learning and data science in python.

- [Rough guide for choosing estimators to try out](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)

### pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) provides efficient data structures and analysis tools for python.

### Various helpfull resources
- [Template folder structure for organizing DS projects](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)
