## Data Science with Python
This list covers only Python, as many are already familiar with this language. [Data Science tutorials using R](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/DataScienceR).

### Learning Python
- [Youtube video tutorial series by sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)
- [Interactive python tutorial website](http://www.learnpython.org/)

### Jupyter Notebooks
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web application for easy visualisation and code-presentation using python.
- [Downloading and running first Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)
- [Example notebook for data exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/simple-exploration-notebook-instacart)


### scikit-learn
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the most common library for machine learning and data science in python.

- [Introduction and first model application](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.02-Introducing-Scikit-Learn.ipynb)
- [Rough guide for choosing estimators](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)

### pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) provides efficient data structures and analysis tools for python.

- [Introduction to pandas](http://www.synesthesiam.com/posts/an-introduction-to-pandas.html)
- [DataCamp pandas foundations](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations) Paid course, but 30 free days upon account creation (enough to complete course)

### Various helpful resources
- [Template folder structure for organizing DS projects](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)
- [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Contains most of the important python packages for Data Science.
