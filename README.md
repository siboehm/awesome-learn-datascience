# Data Science Tutorials & Resources for Beginners [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

*If you want to know more about Data Science but don't know where to start this list is for you!* :chart_with_upwards_trend:

No previous knowledge required but Python and statistics basics will definitely come in handy. These resources have been used successfully for many beginners at my local Data Science student group [ML-KA](http://ml-ka.de/).
